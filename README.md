# My Body Back

**An MVP built as part of the Founders & coders' Tech for Better programme in October 2019**

The app aims to provide support for people with experience of sexual assault. The app will encourage more people to go for a routince cervical screening (smear test).

This project was brought to Founders and Coders by Jane Smallwood who is conducting research as part of her PhD at Royal Holloway, University of London.

This project relies on Jane's research and [My Body Back.](http://www.mybodybackproject.com)

### Design Sprint 

This is when we defined our main [user journey](https://github.com/fac-17/My-Body-Back/wiki/User-Journey) and [user stories](https://github.com/fac-17/My-Body-Back/wiki/User-Stories) as well as running user testing and collating feedback to adjust our approach. We had several iterations of our prototype build with Figma after receiving both peer and user feedback.

### Build sprint one (1 week)

**What we completed** 

* Set up all key routes in app 
* Render all core content to each page 
* Basic styling on each page 
* Tested key functionality 
* researched and scoped Airtable implementation
* More user testing 

More details [here](https://github.com/fac-17/My-Body-Back/wiki/Build-Sprint-1)

### Build sprint two (1 week)

* Airtable setup & netlify-lambda implementation 
* Extra styling: hover effects, icons, tidying 
* Refactored code & tests
* removed DOM manipulation and replaced with proper React implementations 
* Abstracted large chunks of content into a JSON file 
* re-organised file structure 


### What still needs work

* Responsiveness -- We went for a mobile-first design as the majority of our user group would be using the app on a mobile. The desktop version needs some adapting. 
* Editable & downloadable appointment card -- one of the features is a card that users can take to their doctor's appointment. We would have liked to make this editable. 
* Expand the content management -- we used the Airtable API as a database/CMS for our PO to add extra resources to the app in order to create a little more flexibility. This was build as a proof of concept and could be expanded across the app.
